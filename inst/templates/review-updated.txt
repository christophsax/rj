Subject: [RJournal {{id}}] Revised Manuscript
---
Dear {{firstname}},

We have received revisions for manuscript {{id}}, "{{title}}‚Äù incorporating your and other reviewers' feedback. Would you please provide an updated review with the following.  
    - Have your comments have been sufficiently addressed? If not, please provide suggestions to better.
    - Are there other issues with either the package or the manuscript that have been introduced?

As with the first review, it should be returned by email. Our preferred format for the review is a text file attachment, but a pdf is also acceptable. This will be sent on to the authors. Your email should also give your overall recommendation (this part is for the editor only): Accept with minor revisions (you won't see it again), accept with major revisions (you'll re-review the revisions), or reject.


Please let me know if you are unwilling or unable to provide an updated review. I would like to receive the review, if possible, in the next month.

Regards,

{{me}}
