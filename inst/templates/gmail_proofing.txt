Subject: Please proof your R Journal article {{id}}
---
Dear {{name}},

We are pleased to publish your article "{{title}}" to the next issue of the R Journal.

The journal doesn't have a copy editor, and we hope that you can carefully proof the final version of your article. To assist with this, I have include the final versions of the pdf and tex files, and a list of corrections that need to be made produced by our editorial assistant. Any x in the list indicates something that needs fixing. It is also helpful to have a colleague read through it fully.

Please send the final tex and pdf files to me by {{date}}.

Regards,

{{me}}
